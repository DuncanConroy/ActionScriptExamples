This app depends on RenaunsCoreLib files, Starling, and FeathersUI.

Its meant to be built as an AIR desktop app.

This app was a project to learn a bit about Starling and FeathersUI. 
It is not complete and probalby has bugs. It did what I wanted it to do so thats cool.
The NativeProcess is calling out to "/usr/bin/grep" and "/usr/bin/zipgrep" which work on Mac, but probably not on Windows
without some cygwin magic and changing of paths.
It also assumes iTune's Mac mobile applications directory so pretty much a Mac only app at this point.
